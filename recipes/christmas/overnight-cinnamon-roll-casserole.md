# Overnight Cinnamon Roll Casserole

## Casserole Ingredients
- 12 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 2 tablespoons Cinnamon, Ground, divided
- 1 tablespoon Pure Vanilla Extract
- 1 loaf challah bread, cubed
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
- 1/4 cup firmly-packed brown sugar
- 1 batch cream cheese icing (see below)

## Icing
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup powdered (confectioners’) sugar, sifted
- 1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract
- 1–3 teaspoons milk, as needed

## Directions

1. Whisk cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla extract together until smooth.  Add milk — 1 teaspoon at a time — to thin out the icing, until it reaches your desired consistency.  Use immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days.
2. Mix eggs, milk, 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon, and vanilla extract in large bowl with wire whisk until well blended. Add bread cubes, and toss until they are evenly coated with the milk mixture. Pour into a 13 x 9-inch baking dish, that has been prepared with cooking spray. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
3. When you’re ready to bake the casserole, preheat the oven to 350°F. Remove casserole from refrigerator.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together the melted butter, brown sugar and remaining 1 tablespoon cinnamon until combined. Drizzle the mixture evenly over the casserole.
5. Bake uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  While the casserole is baking, prepare the cream cheese icing (see below).
6. Once the casserole is cooked through and toasted on top, remove it from the oven and transfer to a wire cooling rack.  Drizzle the cream cheese icing over the top of the casserole.  Then serve warm, drizzled with extra icing if desired.
