# Roasted Poblano Gravy

## Ingredients
- Pan drippings from guajillo-tamarind turkey
- About 1 cup fat-skimmed chicken broth (if needed)
- 1/4 cup (1/8 lb.) butter
- 3 fresh poblano chiles (8 oz. total), roasted, peeled, seeded, and chopped
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Skim fat from pan drippings. Measure drippings and add chicken broth, if needed, to make 2 cups liquid.
1. In a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium heat, melt butter. Add chiles and stir for 1 minute. Turn heat to medium-low and whisk in flour until well combined.
1. Whisking chile mixture constantly, slowly pour dripping mixture into pan. Whisk until gravy boils and thickens, 6 to 8 minutes. If gravy is thicker than desired, add a little more broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into a gravy boat; serve hot.
