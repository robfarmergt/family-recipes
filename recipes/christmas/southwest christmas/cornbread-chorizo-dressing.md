# Cornbread Chorizo Dressing

## Cornbread

- 1 3/4 cups (210g) Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1 cup (156g) yellow cornmeal
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt, to taste
- 1 1/4 cups (283g) milk, lukewarm
- 4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, melted, cooled
- 1/4 cup (50g) vegetable oil
- 1 large egg

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9" square or round pan (a cast-iron skillet will work fine, too), shallow 1 1/2 quart casserole dish, or 12 muffin cups.
2. Weigh your flour and cornmeal; or measure each by gently spooning into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In another bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the milk, melted butter, vegetable oil, and egg.
4. Pour the liquid all at once into the flour mixture, stirring quickly and gently until just combined. Don't over mix: stir the batter just enough to bring it together and evenly moisten the ingredients.
5. Spread the batter into the prepared pan, or scoop into the muffin tin.
6. Bake the bread for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges just begin to pull away from the pan and a cake tester or paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack
8. Cut into cubes and bake in 300°F oven until dry

## Dressing

- 1 pound Mexican-style fresh chorizo sausage, casings removed
- 1/2 cup (1/4 lb.) butter
- 1 red onion (8 oz.), peeled and chopped
- 1/2 cup chopped celery
- 1/2 cup chopped carrot
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage leaves
- About 2 1/2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth, divided
- 12 cups 3/4-inch cubes cornbread
- Salt and fresh-ground pepper

1. In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium heat, stir chorizo until crumbly and browned (leave some large chunks), about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
2. Return pan to medium-high heat and add butter. When melted, add onion, celery, carrot, and garlic. Stir until vegetables are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add cilantro, thyme, oregano, and sage; stir until fragrant, 1 minute. Add chorizo and 2 cups chicken broth and cook just until boiling. Remove from heat.
3. In a large bowl, combine cornbread cubes and vegetable-chorizo mixture. Stir until evenly moistened, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. If mixture is too dry for your liking, moisten with additional 1/2 cup chicken broth. Spoon into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.
4. Cover and bake in a 450° oven for 10 minutes; uncover and continue to bake until top is browned and dressing is heated through, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Serve hot.
