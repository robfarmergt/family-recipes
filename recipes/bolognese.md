- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 pounds lean ground sirloin
- 1 head of garlic
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 cups beef stock, divided
- 2 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably San Marzano
- 4 tablespoons tomato paste
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, lightly packed
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

**Note:** Makes enough for 3 meals

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the ground sirloin and cook, crumbling the meat with a wooden spoon, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the meat has lost its pink color and has started to brown.
2. Stir in the garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 more minute.
3. Pour beef broth into the pot and stir to scrape up any browned bits. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper, stirring until combined. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.
4. Add the basil and cream to the sauce and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until thickened. Add the parmesan.
